        <p>Before we examine the capabilities of the solution, letâ€™s review its architectural
            background. As illustrated in Figure 1, the CentreStack File Sync and Share platform has
            three primary components:</p>
        <ul id="ul_vsz_tnc_kyb">
            <li>The Storage Layer and the Internal IT infrastructure such as Active Directory and
                File Server - to the right</li>
            <li>The CentreStack Cluster (Server Farm) - at the center</li>
            <li>The CentreStack access client agents - to the left</li>
        </ul>
